# Matrix-Multiplication
Matrix Multiplication performed using Hadoop

This Repository contains the implementation of Matrix Multplication ran on Hadoop Using Map Reduce written in Python.


# Matrix_Mapper.py
This file contains the implementation of mapper. It maps keys according to the the matrix.
For Example,

   We provided this matrices in flatened format as in txt files as we cannot provide data as 2D Array.
   So the first element in Matrix A which refers to 1st row and 1st column which is 5 as follows :
   a,0,0,5
   where "a" represents matrix, "0" represents row number, "0" reprents column number which contains element "5".
   
   After execution of mapper we have keys arranged like:
